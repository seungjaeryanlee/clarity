# Clarity

Clarity is a chess engine written in Python 3.

## Purpose

Clarity is not designed to be a strong chess engine. 
Instead, Clarity is meant to clarify certain algorithms or logics inside chess engines that could be confusing.
To fulfill that purpose, Clarity tends to use descriptive names and comments for every variable and function.

## Dependencies

Clarity was developed in Python 3.5.

Modules:
 * `numpy`  
 * `pytest`  

## Conventions
To make it easy to read, Clarity adheres to numerous conventions. This is a list of conventions it follows:

 * [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
 * [PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
 * [NumPy/SciPy documentation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt)
