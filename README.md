# Clarity
Clarity is a chess engine written in Python 3.

## Purpose
Clarity is not designed to be a strong chess engine. 
Instead, Clarity is meant to clarify certain algorithms or logics inside chess engines that could be confusing.
To fulfill that purpose, Clarity tends to use descriptive names and comments for every variable and function.

## Dependencies
Clarity was developed in Python 3.5.
Modules:
 * `numpy`  
 * `pytest`
